A stock is currently trading at $100. 
You are a market maker and must quote both a bid (buy) 
and an ask (sell) price. If your goal is to make a profit 
from the spread while minimizing risk, how would you set your 
bid and ask prices?


The bid should be $92
Ask price should be $135

This will maximize profit by only purchasing when stocks are low, and selling them when they reach a high point.
