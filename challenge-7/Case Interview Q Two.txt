Case Interview Question: Part Two

Mixed Call Volume

You are given the following information:
    • The total number of calls per hour is 2000.
    • The mix of sales and support calls can vary, with two possible cases:
        1 1200 Sales Calls, 800 Support Calls
        2 800 Sales Calls, 1200 Support Calls
    • There are two types of employees:
        1 Generalists who handle 10 calls per hour and are paid $10 per hour.
        2 Specialists who handle 25 calls per hour and are paid $20 per hour.

Question:
    • How many generalists and specialists should be employed for each of the two possible call distributions?

Answer:
I would once again hire 80 specialists and delegate them accordingly based on the mixed call volume so,
in the first case (48 for sales and 32 for support) and for the second case (32 for sales and 48 for support).
